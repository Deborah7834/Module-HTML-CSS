        <p class="featured-article-summary">
          Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers
          manage changes in their code. It allows teams to collaborate on
          projects by tracking the history of modifications, enabling them to
          revert to previous states if needed.

        <h2>Why Do Developers Need Git?</h2>
        <p class="article-summary">
          Git helps developers by providing a robust system for managing
          different versions of code. It supports collaboration, allowing
          multiple team members to work on the same project without overriding
          each other’s changes. Git also makes it easy to identify issues,
          perform rollbacks, and manage feature development.

        <h2>What is a Branch in Git?</h2>
        <p class="article-summary">
          A branch in Git is a pointer to a specific commit in the project’s
          history. Developers use branches to work on features, bug fixes, or
          experiments separately from the main codebase. Once changes are ready,
          they can be merged back into the main branch, keeping the history
          intact.
